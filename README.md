## Codex fullstack setup

Repository-level Codex behavior is defined in:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `.codex/setup.sh`
- `.codex/maintenance.sh`
- `scripts/codex_fullstack_setup.sh`
- `scripts/codex_fullstack_check.sh`

For Codex cloud, configure the environment setup command as:

```sh
bash .codex/setup.sh
```

For cached Codex cloud environments, configure the maintenance command as:

```sh
bash .codex/maintenance.sh
```

For a complete local or cloud verification pass, run:

```sh
make codex-check
```

## Validate

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_repo.py
```
